# Bulletin
Working for a news organisation, I created Bulletin to experiment with new technologies and also further my skills.
This project was boostrapped with NX, and runs NestJS for the backend, and NextJS for the frontend.

## Run tasks
To run this app locally, run the following commands:
```sh
yarn start:backend
yarn start:bulletin
```

## Inspiration
I am by no means a UI/UX designer, so I cannot take credit for this awesome design.
I based Bulletin off the designs I found on Dribbble by [Alvian Teddy Cahya Putra 👨🏻‍🎨 for Kretya Studio](https://dribbble.com/alvxyz)
